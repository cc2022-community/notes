## Help wanted!

We currently don't have a document for the *Responsive Web Design Certification*. We would appreciate it if you could make one and add notes from your course so far. Make sure to name it `webdev-notes.md` and put it into the `docs` folder. Also follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
